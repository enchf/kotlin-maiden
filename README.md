## Track List

Select a track using `git checkout <song-in-kebab-case>`

### Run to the CLI

```
An input came across the CLI
It brought us help and some printings
It showed us blame, it print a greet
It can be scaled, for our own needs

Run to the CLI
Run your commandsâ€¦
```

We need a CLI that can:

* Show a greeting message.
* Blame against someone.
* Can show help about the commands.
* Can be scaled to add more commands.
